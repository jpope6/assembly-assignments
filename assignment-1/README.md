# Pythagoras' Math Lab

## Overview  
This is an assembly language program that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of its two sides. It prompts the user to enter the length of the first side and the length of the second side of the triangle, and then calculates and displays the length of the hypotenuse.

## User Dialog  
When the program is executed, it displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter the length of the first side of the triangle. The user must enter a floating-point number. After the user enters the length of the first side, the program prompts the user to enter the length of the second side of the triangle. The user must enter a floating-point number.

After the user enters the lengths of both sides of the triangle, the program displays a confirmation message that lists the two values entered by the user. The program then calculates the length of the hypotenuse and displays it as a floating-point number.

Finally, the program displays a closing message and sends a zero to the operating system.
