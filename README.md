# Assembly Class Assignments Repository  
This is a repository for my assignments completed in my assembly language class at CSUF. The repository contains various programs written in assembly language that were assigned throughout the course.

## About Assembly Language  
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to write programs that directly interact with a computer's hardware. It is often used for system-level programming, such as writing device drivers, operating systems, and other software that interacts with hardware.

Assembly language is different from high-level programming languages like Python or Java, as it is much more complex and requires a deep understanding of computer architecture and hardware. Programs written in assembly language are generally faster and more efficient than programs written in high-level languages, but they are also more difficult to write and maintain.

## Assignments  
This repository contains a collection of assignments completed during my assembly language class at CSUF. Each assignment is contained in its own folder and includes a README file with a description of the assignment and any instructions for running the program.
