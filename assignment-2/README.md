Goals
Make an assembly program that teaches all of the following:
=how to make an array
=how to implement iteration
=how to make professional looking programs
=how to reject invalid inputs

Sample run:

Welcome to Arrays of Integers
Bought to you by Jared Pope
This program will manage your arrays of 64-bit floats
For array A enter a sequence of 64-bit floats separated by white space.
After the last input press enter followed by Control+D:
3.2
-12.25
9.7745
21.6
-4.0003
13.1 <enter> <cntl+D>
These number were received and placed into array A:
3.19999 -12.25000 9.77450 21.60000 -4 .00029 13.09992
The magnitude of array A is 16.666666
For array B enter a sequence of 64-bit floats separated by white space.
After the last input press enter followed by Control+D:
16.9
7.0
2.77 <enter> <cntl+D>
These number were received and placed into array B:
16.89999 2.77003
The magnitude of this array B is 8.44444445
Arrays A and B have been appended and given the name A⊕B.
A⊕B contains
3.19999 -12.25000 9.77450 21.60000 -4 .00029 13.09992 16.89999 7.00000
2.77003
The magnitude of A⊕B is 19.74550
Main received 19.7455000000., and will keep it for future use.
Main will return 0 to the operating system. Bye.

NOTE: The numbers for magnitude in the sample are not mathematically correct. They serve to show the relative position of
the digits.
