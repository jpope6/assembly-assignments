Arrays of Integers in Assembly Language

This repository contains an assembly language program that teaches how to make an array, implement iteration, make professional-looking programs, and reject invalid inputs. Additionally, this program allows you to add assembly programming skills to your list of qualifications in your resume.

Program Description

This program is a hybrid program that produces the following output:

Welcome to Arrays of Integers<br>
Bought to you by YOUR NAME HERE<br>
This program will manage your arrays of 64-bit floats<br>
For array A enter a sequence of 64-bit floats separated by white space.<br>
After the last input press enter followed by Control+D:<br>
3.2<br>
-12.25
9.7745
21.6
-4.0003
13.1 <enter> <cntl+D>
These number were received and placed into array A:
3.19999 -12.25000 9.77450 21.60000 -4 .00029 13.09992
The magnitude of array A is 16.666666
For array B enter a sequence of 64-bit floats separated by white space.
After the last input press enter followed by Control+D:
16.9
7.0
2.77 <enter> <cntl+D>
These number were received and placed into array B:
16.89999 2.77003
The magnitude of this array B is 8.44444445
Arrays A and B have been appended and given the name A⊕B.
A⊕B contains
3.19999 -12.25000 9.77450 21.60000 -4 .00029 13.09992 16.89999 7.00000
2.77003
The magnitude of A⊕B is 19.74550
Main received 19.7455000000., and will keep it for future use.
Main will return 0 to the operating system. Bye.

Requirements
To run this program, you need to have a C language compiler installed in your system. Additionally, the source code of each module must be in the language indicated in the calling diagram. You should not put any code in Main except advertising.

The program uses functions taken directly from the libraries of C and C++, and it creates brand new C++ functions when needed. The assembly code outputs floats with 5 places on the right of the decimal point, while the driver outputs floats with 10 decimal places on the right of the decimal point, including trailing zeros.

Credits
This program was created as part of an assignment for an assembly language course. The prompt was designed by the course professor, whose instructions were followed to create this program. If any public function was used in the program, it is documented in the source code.
